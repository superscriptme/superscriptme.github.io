            <h1><strong>HTML</strong></h1>
           
            
            <p>Although, starting HTML in school computer classes looked boring
            and i never gave too much interest or attention to the subject. Later on 
            while i was in England deep interest began to sprout in the online
            filed and i was assured that is where the line started. Now i am 
            hooked on to it and want to get an innate understanding </p>

        <div id="css" class="tabcontent">
            <i class="fab fa-css3 fa-4x"></i>
            <h1>CSS</h1>
            <p>I learnt about CSS in 2013 when i started building a product after
            coming back from the UK. I was surprised when i got to know that all 
            the web designing and the beautiful aspects were controlled by CSS. Much to 
            my expectations i wanted to deep dive in it and eventually i did with taking
                up a course of being a full stack developer with Edwisor.</p>

        <div id="js" class="tabcontent">
            <i class="fab fa-node fa-4x"></i>
            <h1>Javascript</h1>
            <p>While developing Go4Anything, a travel based social networking venture, we had
            to use and work with dynamic content. Literally nothing on our website was static 
            apart from header tabs etc. So we had to work a lot on Jquery and AJAX. I got 
            familiar with these languages, although not comprehensively but only to know 
            that these methods are being worked upon with JS. </p>
        </div>

        <div id="nosql" class="tabcontent">
            <i class="fas fa-database fa-4x"></i>
            <h1>NoSqL</h1>
            <p>I always knew and had a feeling that the world of internet is not run by 
                programming languages or the knowledge of syntax. The world of internet 
                thrives on data, yes!! And who ever controls the data controls the kingdom.
                Have been working from MSSql to MySql and now i am fascinated towork on NoSql to link databases to my future applications.</p>
